## Geometric Model for Helical Auxetic Yarn

A Maple script that produces a geometrical model for 2-component helical auxetic yarns at arbitrary strain. The user may specify the following parameters:

- Elastic core initial diameter
- Winding diameter
- Thickness of optional coating on winding (dielectric layer)
- Initial pitch (helical length)
- Elastic core Poisson's ratio
- Final strain
- Number of turns

The geometry generator has the following assumptions:

- At 0% strain, the yarns contain an extensible elastic core fibre with an inextensible winding.
- The extensible fibre geometry is entirely defined by the extensible fibre (i.e. the inextensible fibre deforms as it would without the presence of the core).
- The fibres are locally stiff, so that the contact path between both is a line.

The script generates 3D renderings of the fibre geometries, an animation of extension from 0% strain to the requested final strain, and cross-sectional bitmap images that can be used to estimate electrical properties.
